<string name="GPS">The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a space-based satellite navigation system that
        provides location and time information in all weather conditions, anywhere on or near the earth where
         there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. The system provides critical
         capabilities to military, civil, and commercial users around the world. The United States government
         created the system, maintains it, and makes it freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.</string>

<string name="WIFI">Wi-Fi (or WiFi) is a local area wireless computer networking technology that allows electronic
             devices to network, mainly using the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz
              (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands.
The WiFi Alliance defines WiFi as any wireless local area network (WLAN) product based on the Ins
titute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers(IEEE) 802.11 standards. However, the term Wi-Fi
is used in general English as a synonym for WLAN since most modern WLANs are based on these standards.
 WiFi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance. The Wi-Fi CERTIFIED trademark can only be used by WiFi
 products that successfully complete WiFi Alliance interoperability certification testing.</string>
<string name="WIFIDirect">Wi-Fi Direct, initially called Wi-Fi P2P, is a Wi-Fi standard enabling devices
           to easily connect with each other  without requiring a wireless access point.
           It is usable for everything from internet browsing to file transfer,
            and to communicate with more than one device simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds.
             One advantage of Wi-Fi Direct is the ability to connect devices even if they are from different manufacturers.
             Only one of the Wi-Fi devices needs to be compliant with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a peer-to-peer connection that
             transfers data directly between them with greatly reduced setup</string>
<string name="Bluetooth">Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard for exchanging data over short distances
          (using short-wavelength UHF radio waves in the ISM band from 2.4 to 2.485 GHz) from fixed and mobile devices,
          and building personal area networks (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor Ericsson in 1994, it was originally
          conceived as a wireless alternative to RS-232 data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming
          problems of synchronization.</string>
<string name="BluetoothLE">Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless
           personal area network technology designed and marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel
           applications in the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries. Compared
           to Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth Smart is intended to provide considerably reduced power consumption and cost
           while maintaining a similar communication range.</string>
<string name="NFC">Near Field Communication (NFC) is a set of short-range wireless technologies, typically
           requiring a distance of 4cm or less to initiate a connection. NFC allows you to share small payloads of
           data between an NFC tag and an Android-powered device, or between two Android-powered devices</string>
<string name="Microphone">A microphone, colloquially mic or mike, is an acoustic-to-electric transducer or
           sensor that converts sound in air into an electrical signal. Microphones are used in many applications
           such as telephones, hearing aids, public address systems for concert halls and public events, motion picture
           production, live and recorded audio engineering, two-way radios, megaphones, radio and television broadcasting,
           and in computers for recording voice, speech recognition, VoIP, and for non-acoustic purposes
           such as ultrasonic checking or knock sensors.</string>
<string name="CameraFlash">A flash is a device used in photography producing a flash of artificial light (typically
           1/1000 to 1/200 of a second) at a color temperature of about 5500 K to help illuminate a scene. A major purpose
            of a flash is to illuminate a dark scene. Other uses are capturing quickly moving objects or changing the quality
             of light. Flash refers either to the flash of light itself or to the electronic flash unit discharging the light.
              Most current flash units are electronic, having evolved from single-use flashbulbs and flammable powders.
              Modern cameras often activate flash units automatically</string>
<string name="USBHost">When your Android-powered device is in USB host mode, it acts as the USB host,
          powers the bus, and enumerates connected USB devices. USB host mode is supported in Android 3.1 and higher</string>
<string name="USBAccessory">USB accessory mode allows users to connect USB host hardware specifically
           designed for Android-powered devices. The accessories must adhere to the Android accessory protocol
            outlined in the Android Accessory Development Kit documentation. This allows Android-powered devices
            that cannot act as a USB host to still interact with USB hardware. When an Android-powered device is
             in USB accessory mode, the attached Android USB accessory acts as the host, provides power to the USB bus,
              and enumerates connected devices. Android 3.1 (API level 12) supports USB accessory mode and the feature
              is also backported to Android 2.3.4 (API level 10) to enable support for a broader range of devices.</string>
<string name="Secondarydisplay">The device supports running activities on secondary displays.</string>
<string name="Audiolowlatency">The device\'s audio pipeline is low-latency, more suitable for audio applications sensitive to delays or lag in sound input or output.</string>
<string name="AudioPro">The device has professional audio level of functionality and performance.</string>
<string name="Camerainfo">The device has a camera facing away from the screen.</string>
<string name="Cameraautofocus">An autofocus (or AF) optical system uses a sensor, a control system and a motor to focus on an automatically or manually selected point or area. An electronic rangefinder has a display instead of the motor; the adjustment of the optical system has to be done manually until indication. Autofocus methods are distinguished by their type as being either active, passive or hybrid variants.</string>
<string name="Printing"> In Android 4.4 (API level 19) and higher, the framework provides services for printing images
          and documents directly from Android applications.Printing also allows them to create a snapshot of information
           that does not depend on having a device, sufficient battery power, or a wireless network connection.</string>

          is designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers,
           with specialized user interfaces for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist
           watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions,
           like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual
           keyboard. Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen input, it also has been used in game consoles,
           digital cameras, regular PCs manufacturer and other electronics.</string>
<string name="OS">An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer or mobile hardware and software resources and
